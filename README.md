# A 4D Christmas

_All I want for Christmas is a playable GBA ROM..._

Get the lastest version [here](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/A-4D-Christmas/releases/download/v0.1/A-4D-Christmas-0-1.gba).

# The idea

[GBA Winter Jam '21](https://itch.io/jam/gba-winter-jam-2021) is coming, so I made this little crappy GBA ROM. This will most probably be my last game released in 2021, and it's a very good chance to celebrate both the Christmas and almost 1 year of me being in the homebrew scene.

Being my very first GBA attempt, I opted for a rough bitmap-mode game with untidy source code. The player's mission is to drive Santa's sleigh in the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension while shooting the dangerous plasma energy spheres. I admit my focus wasn't a very impressive gameplay (_also the original idea was completely different than the final result, but that's another story :))_ ).

I also want to do a (_presumably serious_) text-mode GBA game in the near future.

# How to build

You must have devkitPro with libgba installed and present in your `%PATH%`.

```
git clone https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/A-4D-Christmas
cd A-4D-Christmas
make
```

# Emulation

 ## mGBA
 
 - Enter `Tools->Settings->Enhancements` and set `Video renderer` to `OpenGL` to avoid any chances of emulation freezing.
